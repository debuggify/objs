h3. Build

The project was built using "YUICompressor":http://yuilibrary.com/downloads/#yuicompressor and "YUIant":http://www.ubik-ingenierie.com/miscellanous/YUIAnt/.

h3. Unit Tests

Unit tests are built upon "YUI Test Standalone Library":http://yuilibrary.com/yuitest/.

The tests run by opening the /index.html. The test runner and Unit Test
framework loads all the libraries it needs from the /lib/yuitest folder. They
were first built upon YUI 3.2.0 and YUITest 1.0.0 b1 standalone libraries.
